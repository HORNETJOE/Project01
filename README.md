# Design Documentation
## introduction
This project is a trace ball game. This trace ball game will display the player on the screen as a blue square and a enemy NPC will also be displayed using a red sqaure. the red sqaure will then follow the blue sqaure untill they touch. When the two saures have touched they will be reset back to their original spawing location and then the game will start again. When the player is hit three times the game is display a game over screen and the game will end.

## Process of implementation Algorithm
the process of implementing the algorithm into the program was simple to do. the algorithm for the program was to get the users coordinates so that the NPC would go to the playerâ€™s position to make it look like the NPC was chasing the player. 
## Description of IDE used and features it provided
the IDE I had to use was notepad. it provided no features other than allowing me to type. It provided no features compared to other IDE's
## Debugging process and debugging facilities in your chosen IDE
The Debugging process was difficult because the IDE I had to use had no debugging facilities to help with debugging the code and searching for finding errors.
## Outlining Coding standards used with justification
Coding standards and needed when coding because it makes the code more understandable for other users looking the code or just updates and malignance of the code for the original creator. These standards can be shown through comments made on the code talking about what does what.
## Evaluation: How debugging process helped
the debugging process helped with fixing the code because it allowed me to see the errors in the code and correct them to keep the code working.
