# Design Documentation
## Process of implementation Algorithm
the process of implementing the algorithm into the program was simple to do. the algorithm for the program was to get the users coordinates so that the NPC would go to the players position to make it look like the NPC was chasing the player. 
##  Description of IDE used and features it proveded
the IDE I had to use was notepad. it provided no features other then allowing me to type. It provided no features compaired to other IDE's
## Debugging process and debugging facilities in your chosen IDE
The Debugging process was difficult becuase the IDE I had to use had no debugging facilities to help with debugging the code and searching for finding errors.
## Outlining Coding standards used with justification
Coding standards and needed when coding becuase it makes the code more understandable for other users looking a the code or just updates and matinance of the code for the original creator. These standards can be shown through commrnts made on the code talking about what does what.
## Evaluation: How debugging process helped
the debugging process helped with fixing the code becuase it allowed me to see the errors in the code and correct them to keep the code working.
